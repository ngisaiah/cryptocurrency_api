In this project I created a simple cryptocurrency api which allows you to view prices at the start of the year. This dates back to 2018 and was a good way to sharpen my back-end skills. This project was built using Express and allowed me to familiarize myself with syntax as well as best practices. I plan on expanding this API to date further back than 7 years and to eventually be able to consune data in real-time or close to it.
